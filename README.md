Trivia Game (with teams)

URL: https://category-conquest.vercel.app/

Rules:
This game is a team game where the end goal is to get the most points. The number of teams can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. In the beginning, participants will choose between easy, medium, or hard for the difficulty level, and a certain number of categories will be placed on the screen. The first team chooses a category, and they get to answer a question from that category. Rotate teams. Each question will be of similar difficulty and worth the same number of points. In the end (when all the categories have run out), whichever team has the most amount of points wins.
